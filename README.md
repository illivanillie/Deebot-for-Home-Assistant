# Home Assistant Custom Component for Ecovacs vacuum cleaner

![Preview](images/prev.jpg)

# Know working models:

- Deebot ozmo T8+
- Deebot ozmo T8
- Deebot ozmo T8 AIVI
- Deebot ozmo T5
- Deebot ozmo 960
- Deebot ozmo 950
- Deebot ozmo 920
- .. Possibly all models after 2019

### Other models:

- All non-ozmo devices may not work
- If your robot is working with Native Home Assistant integration that means it will not work with this custom component. please don't open an issue or ask for it.

## Description

With this Home Assistant Custom Component you'll be able to

- play/pause
- locate
- send to home
- clean[auto|map|area]
- track live map
- sensors
- and much more...

## Configuration

### Installation

 To add your Ecovacs devices into your Home Assistant:
   1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz)
   2. In HACS: Go to Integrations and search for -> Deebot for Home Assistant <- and install
   3. Deebot for Home Assistant is now available in Home Assistant under Settings -> Integration -> Add -> Deebot for Home Assistant
   4. Configure as described below

### Chinese server Configuration

For chinese server username you require "short id" and password. short id look like "EXXXXXX". DO NOT USE YOUR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER, it wont work.

country: cn
continent: as (or ww)

Since these servers are in china and unless you are close to china, don't expect very fast response.

### Country and Continent code

#### country:

Your two-letter country code (us, uk, etc).

#### continent:

Your two-letter continent code (as, na, eu, ww).

```
TW, MY, JP, SG, TH, HK, IN, KR -> AS
US -> NA
FR, ES, UK, NO, MX, DE, PT, CH, AU, IT, NL, SE, BE, DK -> EU
Any other country -> WW
```

For some countries, you will need to set continent to ww (meaning worldwide.) There is unfortunately no way to know the correct settings other than guessing and checking.

Additional note: There are some issues during the password encoding. Using some special characters (e.g., -) in your password does not work.

### Sensors

This integration expose a number of sensors
**All sensors are disabled by default.** You can enable only the required ones.

- sensor.ROBOTNAME_last_clean_image (A URL to the last success clean -- the image is on the ecovacs servers)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_brush (% main brush)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_heap (% Filter)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_sidebrush (% Side Brush)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_stats_area (Last or in cleaning Mq2 area)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_stats_time (Last or in cleaning Time)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_stats_type (Clean Type - Auto|Manual|Custom)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_water_level (Current set water level, you can get fan speed by vacuum attributes)
- binary_sensor.ROBOTNAME_mop_attached (On/off is mop is attached)

### Live Map:

If is true live_map it will try to generate a live map camera feed

- camera.ROBOTNAME_liveMap

### Suggested yaml component

A suggested custom lovelace card that i use is: vacuum-card by denysdovhan link: https://github.com/denysdovhan/vacuum-card

My configuration:

```
type: 'custom:vacuum-card'
entity: vacuum.YOURROBOTNAME
image: default
compact_view: false
show_name: true
show_toolbar: true
show_status: true
stats:
  default:
    - entity_id: sensor.YOURROBOTNAME_sidebrush
      unit: '%'
      subtitle: Side Brush
    - entity_id: sensor.YOURROBOTNAME_brush
      unit: '%'
      subtitle: Main Brush
    - entity_id: sensor.YOURROBOTNAME_heap
      unit: '%'
      subtitle: Heap
  cleaning:
    - entity_id: sensor.YOURROBOTNAME_stats_area
      unit: m2
      subtitle: Area
    - entity_id: sensor.YOURROBOTNAME_stats_time
      unit: min
      subtitle: Time
actions:
  - service: script.CLEAN_LIVINGROOM
    icon: 'mdi:sofa'
  - service: script.CLEAN_BEDROOM
    icon: 'mdi:bed-empty'
  - service: script.CLEAN_ALL
    icon: 'mdi:robot-vacuum-variant'
map: camera.ROBOTNAME_liveMap

```

Something like this should be the result:

### Templates

Example for fan_speed:

```
{{ states.vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME.attributes['fan_speed'] }}
```

Get room numbers dynamically, very helpfull if your robot is multi-floor or if your robot lose the map and you don't want to change automations every time:

```
{{ states.vacuum.YOURROBOTNAME.attributes.room_bathroom }}
```

## Example commands:

Relocate Robot (the little GPS icon in the APP)

```
# Relocate Robot
entity_id: vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME
command: relocate
```

You can clean certain area by specify it in rooms params, you can find room number under vacuum attributes

```
# Clean Area
entity_id: vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME
command: spot_area
params:
  rooms: 10,14
  cleanings: 1
```

```
# Customize Clean
# You can get coordinates with fiddler and the official APP [Advance User]
entity_id: vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME
command: custom_area
params:
  coordinates: -1339,-1511,296,-2587
```

```
# Set Water Level
Possible amount values: low|medium|high|ultrahigh
example:

entity_id: vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME
command: set_water
params:
  amount: ultrahigh
```

```
# Clean
